# 3D-Scanner
Intended to be a simple mechatronic system which serves as a mount for a range finder. 
The mount utilises two servo motors to sweep a field while the range finder periodically reads the distance to each point, 
generating a cloud of data. 

The device utilised  was able to transmit the readings via bluetooth to an Excel streadsheet and then 
AutoCAD to generate the resultant 3D model.
